## Problem Statement (2024 Flagship Hackathon UNSW)

In a world where screens have become the new digital playground, every need is just a click away. The new
generation has now become one filled with ‘iPad kids’ - children who spend excessive amounts of time scrolling
on TikTok or playing video games. However, as your parents always said, nothing is more important than your
health! Sedentary lifestyles have become a growing concern due to physical inactivity, poor dietary habits, and
mental health challenges.

So, it’s time to be innovative and promote healthier habits! From your mental to your physical health - there are
numerous avenues to explore and problems you could choose to solve. So what are you waiting for?

Your Task: Create a technical (or non-technical) solution to address these problems (e.g. physical inactivity,
mental health)

## What is Task A Gotchi?

Task-a-Gotchi is a gamified habit tracking app that gives you adorable companions called Gotchis for starting and completing routine tasks.

Users get Gotchi eggs from adding and completing new routines. Users can then incubate these eggs by stepping away from the screen for a certain period and doing something healthy, like taking a walk or meditating.

Whenever users accomplish a healthy habit for the day/week, they get candy to feed their Gotchis and make their levels go higher.

Gotchis live in the Gotchis Nest, which in the future, could have different varieties based on habitats. Gotchis can also have evolutions that will further incentivise people to keep doing their healthy habits.

Users can also both organise and join community events based on good habits and health, such as community yoga, organising a run, or a social event such checking in on everyone, or a book club. Both organisers and users get candy and eggs for attending events. In the future, we could add special egg types and other rewards to facilitate community building.

Lastly, users can compare and show their skills in the global stage, with the global leaderboard feature showing total scores and streaks. Users can also showcase a Gotchi to the world, by setting them as their party lead. In the future, a better profile and friends system would be implemented, which would allow users to compete with friends, family, or other groups.

Task-a-Gotchi is the best way to manage and track your habits, as it combines the habit-forming qualities of gacha and gamification, with building healthy habits and routines for everyone.
